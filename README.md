# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# This code Was built using a React Vite frame work and SCSS along side with tailwind CSS
## The API is consumed from The Movie Data Base (TMDB)
### The page Components are in a Components folder
Here I placed the Atoms, Molecules, Organisms and pages folders
Each of these folders hold a functionality
# Like the Movie card folder holds the movie list called by Fetch hook and arranged using the map function that is re-rendered using the useState hook
## The Navbar and the Hero folder are used for the search and the display of the movie header
# The movieDetails is used for displaying the movies searched
